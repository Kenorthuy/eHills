This is an auction simulation application that I created as a final project for EE 422C at UT. The main highlights, challenges, and learning opportunities came with the inclusion of a cloud database (MongoDB) to store JSON strings which could then be converted to a Java Object using an external library (Gson). This component of my project required a lot of independent research and I learned a lot about databases from it.
